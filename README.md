# Secure Passphrase Generator - Powered by untroubled.org
Passphrases generated by https://untroubled.org/pwgen/ppgen.cgi with an added level of security including special characters and letter/number substitutions.


## About
All credit for actual passphrase generation goes to untroubled.org

Being in cybersecurity, I've come to value my account safety a lot. I've worked to keep all my accounts fully secured which can sometimes be difficult when you can't copy and paste them over (as can be the case on consoles for example). For this reason, I started using passphrases as they are friendlier to type whilst maintaining their level of protection. I generated them on untroubled.org then sprinkled in another level of protection by manually changing some letters to numbers and adding in special characters - a process that can get quite boring which is why I created this simple automation script to help speed that up. 


## Features

- Decide how many letter/number substitutions to perform
- Special characters included for extra security
