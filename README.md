## About
All credit for actual passphrase generation goes to untroubled.org

Being in cybersecurity, I've come to value my account safety a lot. I've worked hard to keep all my accounts secure which can sometimes be difficult when you can't copy and paste them over (as can be the case on consoles for example). For this reason, I started using passphrases as they are friendlier to type whilst maintaining a high level of protection. Previously, I generated them on untroubled.org then sprinkled in another level of protection by manually changing some letters to numbers and adding in special characters - a process that can get quite boring which is why I created this simple automation script to help speed that up. 


## Features
- Use preset configurations to quickly generate passphrases
- Choose number of words, their lengths and number lengths
- Decide how many letter/number substitutions to perform
- Special characters included for extra security

## Usage
